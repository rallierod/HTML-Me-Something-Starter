      <center>Hi! &#128400; <p><b>I'm Allie!</b></p>
         <center>
   </h2>

   <p>While sitting and thinking about what I wanted my website to be about, I realized I was spending a ridiculous
      amount of time <b>overanalyzing</b>. According to <a>Merriem Webster</a> overanalysis is excessive analysis.</p>

   <p>To be honest, I had approximately 152 different
      thoughts (+/- 100 or so) that I could do for my website.</p>

   <p>As I sat on my couch stairing blankly into space and pondered, my never&ndash;ending to&ndash;do&ndash;list was weaving its way
      into my mind. Things like &mdash; Lesson plans, laundry, momming, cleaning (always cleaning), launchCode lessons,
      budgets, bills, taxes, thank you cards from my wedding almost 10 years ago......</p>
   <p> The list goes on...
   <p>
   <p>And on...</p>
   <p>And on and on...</p>
   <p>And on and on and on... </p>
   <p>And on and on and</p>
   <p>&#127879; BAM</p>
   <p>&ldquo;A DOOM BOX!&rdquo;</p>

   <p>You may be asking yourself &mdash; &ldquo;What on earth is a doom box?&rdquo; And that, my friend, is a valid question!</p>

   <p>I present you with exhibit A:</p>

   <img src="/Users/alexandrarodgers/Desktop/LaunchCode/assignment-4-html-me-something-rallierod/images/Elsa.jpg"
      alt="doom box" style="width:20%; height:auto;">
    
      

   <p>A doom box is the box of things you don&apos;t know what to do with after you have used all of your bandwidth for
      cleaning or organizing for that day.</p>

   <p>You throw all the extra random stuff into the box and then move it to the determined &ldquo;doom&rdquo; location. At a later
      time/date you remember the doom box and get to find the missing treasures you forgot about. So really it&apos;s a box
      that <em>eventually</em> sparks joy! Therefore it <em>should</em> make Marie Kando proud and should be considered a phenomenal organization strategy.&#129315; </p>

   <p> This website is going to be like that. Just random treasures from my brain that spark joy!</p>

   <p>Below you will find a list of thoughts and ideas that I can promise have had a thorough overan<b>ALLIE</b>sis by
      yours truly. Some are the overanalysis of movies I have watched over and over again with Fallon and Ellie. Or
      songs I have obsessively overplayed to dissect meaning. And some are just things I&apos;ve started and either
      completed, kind of completed, or will hopefully someday complete.</p>

   <p>Enjoy!</p>
