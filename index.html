               <p><span>I spent DAYS overanalyzing and thinking about what
                     the contents of my website should include.

                     <span>I left the comfort and chaos of my house to walk down the
                        street to my parent&apos;s house to sit on their couch and
                        overanalyze the same things I had been overanalyzing for the
                        days prior. I was staring into space when…</span>
                     <span></span>
                     <span>
                        <p2>&#128165;</p2>

                     <span><p2>BAM!</p2></span><span></span><span> It hit me!</span>


                     <span>I could make my website, a “throw&ndash;it&ndash;in&ndash;box”! </span>

                     <span>I know what you&apos;re thinking&mdash; ”What in the world is a &apos;throw&ndash;it&ndash;in&ndash;box&apos;?”</span>
                     I present to you
                     <span>Exhibit A:</span>

                     <span>A place where you put all of the things when your bandwidth has
                        run out for
                        the day. <span>It becomes a random assortment of treasures that you happily misplace for a while. Then one day
                        you realize you need something that was in the box. You go to search through the box and that's when you
                        find tons of missing treasures! </span>
                        
                        <span>You get distracted and forget what you were looking for in the first place! The spiral continues.</span>

                     <span>This is my “throw-it-in-box”. In digital form...A random assortment of overanALLIEsis and
                        magnificent

            <p>Elsa: in Frozen is her having to come to terms with and recognize with the trauma of not only losing her
               parents
               but also the trauma of processing the emotional turmoil and grief of masking her true identity in order
               to
               please other people
               around her. She has such a deeply embedded trauma response to her “powers” that she is not good and
               doesn&apos;t deserve love because she is “not good”. Since childhood Elsa was constantly told to mask or
               conceal
               her feelings! “Conceal don&apos;t feel”. <span>More details coming soon!</span>

                  This is my most in depth analysis. I realized as I wanted to start it 
                  is way better to actually explain when I am talking because trying to rationalize the chaos
                  for someone else to read and process is kind of a nightmare. But I'll get there.
